I am a Security Analyst and project manager with over 2 years of experience helping businesses use new technologies to drive success. With a deep understanding of technological systems and an innate ability to identify and mitigate potential security threats, I am committed to safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of information systems. I possess exceptional problem-solving abilities and a strong passion for continuous learning in the field of cybersecurity. With a proactive mindset, I actively seek out innovative and creative ways to protect against emerging threats and contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity practices. I am passionate about enlightening people and making them understand the basics of security awareness and to enlighten them on how to increase their security posture. And most importantly, I value having fun and being collaborative, inclusive, and authentic while I do it.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Team as a Tier 1 Analyst or work as an Incident response analyst or in the Identity and Access Management team.
