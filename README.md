# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Adeoluwa Obadofin  
**Information Security Analyst | ISMS Manager | DPO | AI Governance Consultant**  

I design and implement governance frameworks that transform cybersecurity from a compliance checkbox into a competitive advantage.   
My work focuses on helping organizations securely adopt AI technologies while aligning with global standards such as ISO 42001, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF. I provide frameworks, policies, and risk-based oversight to ensure AI systems are ethical, transparent, and secure. My work bridges **technology, trust, and regulation** aligning ISO 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR, NDPR, and AI Governance principles to build resilient, privacy-conscious organizations.

## 🧠 About Me  

I’m an Information Security Analyst with specialization in AI Governance and Security, **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**.  
My professional journey centers on designing and executing frameworks that help organizations mature their security posture, achieve certification readiness, and maintain continuous compliance.  

I’ve led and contributed to multiple compliance and assurance initiatives, including:  
- AI governance and responsible risk management
- AI Security Assessment
- ISO 27001 implementation and internal audits
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Policy development  
- GDPR and NDPR gap assessments  
- Security awareness training programs for remote and on-site teams  
- Third-party risk management and audit readiness  

My philosophy: **Good governance is good business and measurable trust is the new currency.**
